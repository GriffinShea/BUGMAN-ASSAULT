USE THE DEMO_MODE TOGGLE ON THE WORLD OBJECT (IN UNITY PROJECT EDITOR) TO SWAP BETWEEN DEMO MODE (ALL UNITS AND BUILDINGS INITIALLY SPAWNED) AND GAME MODE (PLAYER STARTS WITH STOCKPILE, ONE BARRACKS, AND ONE BUILDER) (THIS IS THE WAY THE GAME WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYED).



OBJECTS:
MetalSupply = grey cube
GasSupply = orange cylinders with gas speying out

Stockpile = fat green cylinder
Factory = big red box
Turret = skinny green tower
Barracks = little green box

Collector = blue capsule
Builder = flat blue box
Tank = red flattened sphere with turret

Hive = big orange sphere
Warrior = red bugman
Scout = yellow bugman



Walkthrough:
1. select builder and use it to build a factory.
2. select the factory and use it to build two collectors.
3. select the collectors and use them to collect from metal supplies on the map.
4. use the builder to build harvesters on gas supplies and barracks, gas and manpower are needed to make more units.

Additional guidelines/tips:
5. remember to retarget collectors which have depleated metal supplies on the map.
6. the builder can also create turrets to defend your buildings and units, and additional factories.
7. use the factory to make more builders, collectors, and tanks.
8. use tanks to target enemies and to eventually go on the offensive and assault the bugmen hive to win the game.
9. when a scout finds a player's unit or building, it will run back to the hive to report the location and then the warriors will begin an assault. you can use tanks to hunt these scouts down before they reach the hive or you can let them detect you far from your base in order to bait an assault toward that location.
10. you lose the game if the warriors destroy your stockpile.
